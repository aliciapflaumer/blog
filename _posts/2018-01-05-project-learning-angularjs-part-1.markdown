During the first blizzard of 2018, what better thing is there to do than to code in pajamas?

In my job search, one technology that I've been seeing in job descriptions is Angular. What is Angular? Angular 2 is a TypeScript-based open-source front-end web application platform.

In planning for a project, I started to think about what I could build with it as I'm learning the technology. I decided to just build a basic application.

I've been referring to the [Angular docs][angular-docs] and making some use of tutorials on YouTube.

The [app][angular-app] that I'm building currently has navigation and routes to more than one component. I'm pretty excited to get to that point actually, and to get it deployed.

The idea that I have seems like a real-world scenerio, of an app that does many things. For example, building a simple quiz and have it be within one component. And learning how to build a simple sprite game with Phaser (a technology that I've been wanting to dig into), and have that be another component within this one application. Then, maybe, have another component be a "list of things."

This is a work-in-progress.

If you want to checkout my [Github repo][github-repo] to see my code, feel free.

*Correction: An earlier version referenced the platform as AngularJS, when actually it is just Angular.*
