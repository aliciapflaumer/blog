Have you ever had a friendship that was the kind that after months, even years, without seeing each other. You are able to pick up where you both left off from the last time?

I have. 

Back when we were roommates –– in a pre-digital time when color 35mm film was the medium of choice –– I had taken a photo of my friend Heather in her bedroom/studio. In the photo, she is crouching down in front of one of her large paintings. 

Heather was an artist, whose work was dreamlike, before she passed away unexpected in 2017. 

Artists inspire artists and this photo of Heather has become the inspiration behind an idea. I hope to create a photography documentary series depicting various artists –– of different styles and media –– in their own creative space. 

If you would like to participate and featured, or know someone who would, I'd love to hear from you. Let's collaborate!
