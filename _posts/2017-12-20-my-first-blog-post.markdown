I'm utilizing LinkedIn, making connections, sending cold apps, and getting some phone screens, but the process feels like it's moving very slow.

Here, I will try to write about my thought process in my job search,
about what new technologies I want to learn or are learning, and about projects that I'm working on.

*Updated 12/29: To add more about the build process*

The first step to blogging was actually creating this site. Taking some inspiration from a friend, I decided to learn about creating it with Jekyll. I liked the idea of keeping up with my git skills while blogging. I can write posts in the Atom text editor, and commit & push to my gh-pages branch on Github to make posts live.

To get started, I just followed the instructions in the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs]. This was actually a good continued learning curve. When something didn't work, I referred back to the docs to troubleshoot the issue. To get it to work I created a new `gh-pages` branch locally via the command line in my project folder, and then pushed to Github. To make my first post live, on Github I merged the up-to-date master branch into the gh-pages branch.

Happy to share & thank you for reading.
