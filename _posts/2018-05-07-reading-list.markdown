# Have Read

"[Where do we go from here: Chaos or Community?](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0807000671/){:target="_blank"}" by Martin Luther King, Jr.
>This is Martin Luther King, Jr.'s last book, written in 1967 – he was assassinated the following year. The views seem eerily chilling and relevant still today – more than 50 years later. I highly recommend this book.

"[Forward](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/006246700X/){:target="_blank"}" by Abby Wambach

"[Untamed](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1984801252/){:target="_blank"}" by Glennon Doyle
>"We can do hard things", that is an important takeaway from reading this book. It's written in a sort of short story form, and I found myself laughing out loud often. Glennon is a great storyteller with a great sense of humor. A fun read with a purpose and I highly recommend for any human.

"[Becoming](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1524763136/){:target="_blank"}" by Michelle Obama
>This is an honest and uplifting read about the former first lady, her career, her family, and the many initiatives she started – I hardly could put it down.

"[It's What I do: A Photographer's Life of Love and War](https://www.amazon.com/Its-What-Do-Photographers-Life/dp/0143128418){:target="_blank"}" by Lynsey Addario

"[A People's History of the United States](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015XEWZHI/){:target="_blank"}" by Howard Zinn
>This book will knock you off your A**. The real story of the history of the United States, told through the perspective of underrepresented individuals/groups. Not the story told in your school-age history books.

"[No Better Time: The Brief, Remarkable life of Danny Lewin, the Genius Who Transformed the Internet](https://www.amazon.com/No-Better-Time-Remarkable-Transformed/dp/0306821664/){:target="_blank"}" by Molly Knight Raskin<br />
>If you're interested in learning about how a once-small tech startup went from 0 to being one of the top Internet technology companies in the world –– you will like this book. It's really inspiring to read the story of the relationship of a student and his mentor-professor-friend, with a sad true-story ending.

"[No Walls and the Recurring Dream: A Memoir](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JYSMCK1/){:target="_blank"}" by Ani DiFranco

*FWIW, during my time as a student at General Assembly I created my own app to do something just as similiar to help track the books on your stack, if you're curious you can check it out [here](https://aliciapflaumer.github.io/got-reads-front-end/){:target="_blank"}.*
