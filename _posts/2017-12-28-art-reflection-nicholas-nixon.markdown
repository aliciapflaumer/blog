**Today was cold outside,** it would have been easy to just stay warm at home. I decided to step away from the computer and go see a photography exhibit at the Institute of Contemporay Art in Boston. Afterall, one of my favorite documentary photographers was on exhibit. The show is titled "Nicholas Nixon: Persistance of Vision." There is a fantastic quote by the artist displayed under the title, "The world is infinitely more interesting than any of my opinions about it."

Reflection, admiration, inspiration are words one might think of when they view the photographs by Nixon.

The first time I was introduced to his work was on recommendation back in the '90's by one of my photography professors and mentors. I was a senior at Montserrat College of Art and during that time in my life I was determined to be a documentary photographer. I loved working in the darkroom and I liked telling stories with my camera, I'm not a writer, I express myself best with visuals.

A lot of Nixon's photographs are taken of family and relationships.

The photos that stand out to me the most are the close-ups. I relate to that style of photography, capturing subjects closer than you'd normally expect them to be â€“ sometimes even uncomfortable-like.
