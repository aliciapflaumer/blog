*Tip to stay fresh and relevant:*

Keep a whiteboard with a code challenge written on it, where you'll see it everyday during the week.

  • Use Pseudocode

  • Break it apart

  • Take your time

  • Write test cases (if there is room, if not use your favorite IDE)

  • Find a solution (and then find another one, there is always more than one way to do things)
