      <h2>Getting started with blogging: job search, new tech, and projects</h2>
<p class="meta">December 20, 2017</p>

<p>I’m utilizing LinkedIn, making connections, sending cold apps, and getting some phone screens, but the process feels like it’s moving very slow.</p>

<p>Here, I will try to write about my thought process in my job search,
about what new technologies I want to learn or are learning, and about projects that I’m working on.</p>

<p><em>Updated 12/29: To add more about the build process</em></p>

<p>The first step to blogging was actually creating this site. Taking some inspiration from a friend, I decided to learn about creating it with Jekyll. I liked the idea of keeping up with my git skills while blogging. I can write posts in the Atom text editor, and commit &amp; push to my gh-pages branch on Github to make posts live.</p>

<p>To get started, I just followed the instructions in the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/">Jekyll docs</a>. This was actually a good continued learning curve. When something didn’t work, I referred back to the docs to troubleshoot the issue. To get it to work I created a new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gh-pages</code> branch locally via the command line in my project folder, and then pushed to Github. To make my first post live, on Github I merged the up-to-date master branch into the gh-pages branch.</p>

<p>Happy to share &amp; thank you for reading.</p>
