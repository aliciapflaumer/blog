<p>During the first blizzard of 2018, what better thing is there to do than to code in pajamas?</p>

<p>In my job search, one technology that I’ve been seeing in job descriptions is Angular. What is Angular? Angular 2 is a TypeScript-based open-source front-end web application platform.</p>

<p>In planning for a project, I started to think about what I could build with it as I’m learning the technology. I decided to just build a basic application.</p>

<p>I’ve been referring to the <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular docs</a> and making some use of tutorials on YouTube.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://aliciapflaumer.github.io/angular-app/">app</a> that I’m building currently has navigation and routes to more than one component. I’m pretty excited to get to that point actually, and to get it deployed.</p>

<p>The idea that I have seems like a real-world scenerio, of an app that does many things. For example, building a simple quiz and have it be within one component. And learning how to build a simple sprite game with Phaser (a technology that I’ve been wanting to dig into), and have that be another component within this one application. Then, maybe, have another component be a “list of things.”</p>

<p>This is a work-in-progress.</p>

<p>If you want to checkout my <a href="https://github.com/aliciapflaumer/angular-app">Github repo</a> to see my code, feel free.</p>

<p><em>Correction: An earlier version referenced the platform as AngularJS, when actually it is just Angular.</em></p>
