<em>A road to somewhere in Southern Utah, September, 2024</em></p>

<h3 id="week-one">Week One</h3>

<p><em>This is my own opinion through my own social media experience over many years.</em></p>

<p>I have decided to take a little break from using some social media apps. To help move through the process of going without, I thought it would be a good idea to document the process through writing about the experience.</p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>Generally I am finding social media to not be useful — or at least consider it to be very low on the useful scale — aside from using it for business, keeping in touch with connections, and it has been helpful in parts of the world that have seen wars and in countries contolled by dictatorship. Aside from that, lately I am finding it to be a distraction and despite the use of the phrase ‘social media’ I’m finding it to be disconnecting and addictive.</p>

<p>Yes it is designed to connect the world to each other — and that can be great — but I feel that it is also designed to be an addiction to its users. It all depends on how many followers one might have, how much do they interact and to what content they are interacting with, what they are posting themselves and how other people are interacting with their content, it all feeds into the addictive part of the brain making us more distracted, anxious, and maybe more self-centered – and the social media companies win by getting more revenue from advertisers, it is a business afterall, and the users are the product.</p>

<p>Numerous times in recent years I have asked myself if I could do without social media applications. I do not use too many — Facebook very sparelingly, Instagram to keep up with everyone such as friends, family, co-workers, and following popular people who are stangers to me that I find interesting whether that be in politics, exercise, and for plain ol’ amusing entertainment. I also use LinkedIn for professional connections and networking. I have not had a Twitter account since an estimated 6 years ago or maybe longer — I do not remember when but it was still known as Twitter. I have never used Snapchat or Tiktok — neither one has any interest to me.</p>

<h3 id="goal-and-benefits">Goal and Benefits</h3>

<p>I have been slowly moving away from using the social media apps that I am connected with. After scrolling sessions on Instagram I would log off of the app. But kept the app on my phone — for easy access to log back in later. Logging in less each day but found it to be difficult to go a whole day without logging back in to see what I missed.</p>

<p>Well, a few days ago I began an attempt to not just log out but to go a step further and deactivate my Facebook and Instagram accounts. The goal is to disconnect from these outlets with the hopes to improve my focus on offline activities.</p>

<p>I have a stack of books I wish to get through — both for continued learning and entertainment — as well as working my way through a couple of Peloton exercise programs.</p>

<p>2025 looks hopeful.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-learned-so-far">What is learned so far</h3>

<p>A few days in and I am already beginning to feel some withdrawal symptoms — wondering if I am missing out on anything.</p>

<p>I may be back… I shall see how this experiment works.</p>
