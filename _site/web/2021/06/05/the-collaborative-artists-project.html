<p>Have you ever had a friendship that was the kind that after months, even years, without seeing each other. You are able to pick up where you both left off from the last time?</p>

<p>I have.</p>

<p>Back when we were roommates –– in a pre-digital time when color 35mm film was the medium of choice –– I had taken a photo of my friend Heather in her bedroom/studio. In the photo, she is crouching down in front of one of her large paintings.</p>

<p>Heather was an artist, whose work was dreamlike, before she passed away unexpectedly in 2017.</p>

<p>Artists inspire artists and this photo of Heather has become the inspiration behind an idea. As part of an interest in the process of how creativity flows, as a side project from my current full-time job, I hope to create a photography documentary series depicting various artists –– of different styles and media –– in their own creative space.</p>

<p>If you would like to participate and be featured, or know someone who would, I’d love to hear from you. Please fill out the contact form below and let’s collaborate!</p>
