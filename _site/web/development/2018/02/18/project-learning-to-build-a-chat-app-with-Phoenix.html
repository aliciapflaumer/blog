      <h2>Project: Building a chat app with Phoenix</h2>

<p>Last month when I participated in a <a href="https://aliciapflaumer.github.io/alicia/web/development/hackathon/2018/01/26/getting-out-of-my-own-way.html">hackathon</a> I also learned about a new framework, new to me that is, from one of my teammates. She, a computer science student, showed me a chat application that she had built for class. I had never heard of this framework before so I was intrigued and thought to myself that I would like to put that on my list of things to try to learn.</p>

<p>So what is Phoenix? It is a framework that uses the Elixir programming language, which looks a lot like Ruby on Rails. Just like Ruby we have a router, models, views, and controllers. We also have HTML, CSS, and Javascript. (Checkout the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/overview.html">Phoenix docs overview</a> page if you care to dive deeper. <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a> also has their own documentation.) So it seems like the front-end and back-end are married together in a nice &amp; neat package.
Sweeeet!!</p>

<p>I wanted to just build a basic application to become more familiar with this technology. Nothing fancy.</p>

<p>I did some research, and by that I mean I searched on Google, and found a great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irDC1nWKhZ8">Youtube tutorial</a> that demonstrated through the process step-by-step in 3 video segments. This wasn’t the first of what I found in my search but it most definitely was the most helpful. There are a lot of steps in the process, and I’ll say that authentication took the most time.</p>

<p>The project that I’ve titled ‘Babble’ is a work in progress. I may or may not expand on it, and personalize it more. There are a couple of features that are on the ‘nice to have’ wishlist, such as:</p>

<p>• Show Username instead of email address after the ‘Hello there’ message, and within the chat dialogue box.</p>

<p>• Currently once a user leaves the chat page, the previous chat is not saved.</p>

<p>• Currently the app isn’t exclusive to specific user groups, whomever is signed-in is seen as online.</p>

<p>The experience was good to become aware of all that goes into building a chat application.</p>

<p>Feel free to try out the application that I built <a href="https://babble.herokuapp.com/">here</a> yourself, and you never know whom you might find online with you.</p>

<p>If your curious about the code you can checkout it on my <a href="https://github.com/aliciapflaumer/babble">Github</a> repo.</p>
