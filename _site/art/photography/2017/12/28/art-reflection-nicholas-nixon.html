      <h2>Art reflection: Nicholas Nixon</h2>

<p><strong>Today was cold outside,</strong> it would have been easy to just stay warm at home. I decided to step away from the computer and go see a photography exhibit at the Institute of Contemporay Art in Boston. Afterall, one of my favorite documentary photographers was on exhibit. The show is titled “Nicholas Nixon: Persistance of Vision.” There is a fantastic quote by the artist displayed under the title, “The world is infinitely more interesting than any of my opinions about it.”</p>

<p>Reflection, admiration, inspiration are words one might think of when they view the photographs by Nixon.</p>

<p>The first time I was introduced to his work was on recommendation back in the ‘90’s by one of my photography professors and mentors. I was a senior at Montserrat College of Art and during that time in my life I was determined to be a documentary photographer. I loved working in the darkroom and I liked telling stories with my camera, I’m not a writer, I express myself best with visuals.</p>

<p>A lot of Nixon’s photographs are taken of family and relationships.</p>

<p>The photos that stand out to me the most are the close-ups. I relate to that style of photography, capturing subjects closer than you’d normally expect them to be – sometimes even uncomfortable-like.</p>
