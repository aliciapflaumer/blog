<p>A list of books I’m currently reading, want to read, and have read, as well as articles I found interesting, in relation to obtaining self-driven goals.</p>

<p><strong>Updated: Sept 16, 2020</strong></p>

<h1 id="have-read">Have Read</h1>

<p>“<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1984824767/" target="_blank">Girl Decoded</a>” by Rana el Kaliouby</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Essentially about a woman who, through cultural discovery, learned that it is okay to be yourself, take risks, and make “crazy ideas” come true.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0807000671/" target="_blank">Where do we go from here: Chaos or Community?</a>” by Martin Luther King, Jr.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This is Martin Luther King, Jr.’s last book, written in 1967 – he was assassinated the following year. The views seem eerily chilling and relevant still today – more than 50 years later. I highly recommend this book.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/006246700X/" target="_blank">Forward</a>” by Abby Wambach</p>

<p>“<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1984801252/" target="_blank">Untamed</a>” by Glennon Doyle</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“We can do hard things”, that is an important takeaway from reading this book. It’s written in a sort of short story form, and I found myself laughing out loud often. Glennon is a great storyteller with a great sense of humor. A fun read with a purpose and I highly recommend for any human.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1524763136/" target="_blank">Becoming</a>” by Michelle Obama</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This is an honest and uplifting read about the former first lady, her career, her family, and the many initiatives she started – I hardly could put it down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Its-What-Do-Photographers-Life/dp/0143128418" target="_blank">It’s What I do: A Photographer’s Life of Love and War</a>” by Lynsey Addario</p>

<p>“<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015XEWZHI/" target="_blank">A People’s History of the United States</a>” by Howard Zinn</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This book will knock you off your A**. The real story of the history of the United States, told through the perspective of underrepresented individuals/groups. Not the story told in your school-age history books.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“<a href="https://www.amazon.com/No-Better-Time-Remarkable-Transformed/dp/0306821664/" target="_blank">No Better Time: The Brief, Remarkable life of Danny Lewin, the Genius Who Transformed the Internet</a>” by Molly Knight Raskin<br /></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>If you’re interested in learning about how a once-small tech startup went from 0 to being one of the top Internet technology companies in the world –– you will like this book. It’s really inspiring to read the story of the relationship of a student and his mentor-professor-friend, with a sad true-story ending.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262661152/" target="_blank">Affective Computing</a>” by Rosalind Picard</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I discovered this book when reading “Girl Decoded”, Picard was a mentor of Rana el Kaliouby and the two co-founded Affectiva.</p>
</blockquote>

<em>FWIW, during my time as a student at General Assembly I created my own app to do something just as similiar to help track the books on your stack, if you’re curious you can check it out <a href="https://aliciapflaumer.github.io/got-reads-front-end/" target="_blank">here</a>.</em></p>
